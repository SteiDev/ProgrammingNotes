## Conventions
### Hidden Files
Files starting with **.** (PERIOD) are hidden by default.
### Case sensitivity
File names are case sensitive (FILE1 is not the same as file1).
### Lack of file extension
Linux itself has no concept of file extensions.

*Note: While the OS has no concept of file extensions, other applications may have that concept*
